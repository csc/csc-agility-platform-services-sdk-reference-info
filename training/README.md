# Agility Platform Services SDK Training

The [slides](https://github.com/csc/agility-platform-services-sdk-reference-info/blob/master/training/AgilityPlatformServicesSDK.pptx) are from a Services SDK class.

Two subdirectories are for exercises from the slides:
* promise.exercises: Work through practical use cases for `com.servicemesh.core.async.Promise`
* services.training: Provides a framework for service adapter development

The third directory, mock.adapter, provides a reference implementation of the *Mock Service* adapter. It provides some fuller examples of material discussed in the slides.

Eclipse projects are defined for all three subdirectories.
