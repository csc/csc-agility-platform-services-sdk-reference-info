# Agility Platform Services SDK Training

The [slides](https://github.com/csc/agility-platform-services-sdk-reference-info/blob/master/training/AgilityPlatformServicesSDK.pptx) are from a Services SDK class.

Two subdirectories are for exercises from the slides:
* promise.exercises: Work through practical use cases for `com.servicemesh.core.async.Promise`
* services.training: Provides a framework for service adapter development

Two other subdirectories provide fuller examples of material discussed in the slides:
* mock.adapter: provides a reference implementation of the *Mock Service* adapter. This adapter illustrates advanced concepts such as creating a Package and assigning it to a Template.
* mock.netsvc: provides a reference implementation of the *Mock Network Service* adapter. This adapter illustrates a pure network service that requires no Service asset type.

Eclipse projects are defined for all subdirectories.
